Welcome to the Data and Measurement course repository! 

This repository serves as a resource for students enrolled in the Data and Measurement course and contains exercises that we will cover during our tutorial sessions on Fridays. These exercises are meant to reinforce your understanding of the course material and provide opportunities for hands-on practice.

### Datasets

The datasets required for the exercises are included in this repository. You can find them in the datasets directory. 

### Exercises

The exercises are organized in the exercises directory. Each exercise is prepared in R Markdown and compiled into an HTML file for easy viewing. You can find detailed instructions and prompts within each exercise file to guide you through the tasks.

### Answers

I add the HTML files containing the exercise answers every Friday after 15:00. This allows you to attempt the exercises independently before referring to the provided solutions. You can find the updated files in the same directory as the exercises.

Feel free to explore the repository and use the materials provided to enhance your learning experience in the Data and Measurement course. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Happy learning! ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ
